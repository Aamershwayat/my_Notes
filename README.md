# **Developer mindset:**
- The purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander.

- Code Simplicity : Every programmer is a designer.

- The developer design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters.

- You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

- Actually, one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

- Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer "Max Kanat-Alexander".

- A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

- It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation. 'Max Kanat-Alexander'.

- Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
